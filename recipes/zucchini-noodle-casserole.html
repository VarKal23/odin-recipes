        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Zucchini Noodles are a delicious and healthy gluten-free pasta alternative made 
            from zucchini! A type of squash, zucchini is low in calories, fat, and 
            carbohydrates, and thanks to their mild, somewhat watery taste, they pair 
            well with just about everything.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>5 zucchini squash, cut into 'noodles' using a spiral slicer or vegetable peeler</li>
            <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar marinara sauce, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) container 2% Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches,
                saute enough zucchini to fit in the skillet with 1 teaspoon garlic until zucchini
                is slightly browned and softened, 3 to 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining olive 
                oil, zucchini, and garlic. Transfer cooked zucchini mixture to a 9x13-inch baking
                dish.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Whisk marinara sauce, yogurt, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in
                a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until sauce is warmed through, 5 to 10 
                minutes. Pour sauce over zucchini mixture in the baking dish. Sprinkle mozzarella 
                cheese and a pinch of Italian seasoning over the top.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes.</p></li>
        </ol>
